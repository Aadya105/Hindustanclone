# HindustanClone

A clone or replica of the Hindustan-style news/website UI built using modern web technologies.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**HindustanClone** is a project aiming to replicate the look and feel of a popular Hindi-language news site (or similar media portal), for educational / demonstration purposes.  
It replicates layout, styling, and basic web navigation to offer a “news-site style” frontend skeleton.  
This project is intended for learning, UI-design practice, and experimentation — not for commercial publishing of news content.
